# Password-Generator

The Password Generator is a tool designed to create strong, random passwords to enhance security for user accounts and sensitive information.

2. Character Options: Users can choose to include:
3. Uppercase letters (A-Z)
4. Lowercase letters (a-z)
5. Numbers (0-9)
6. Special characters (e.g., !@#$%^&*)
7. Random Password Generation: The tool generates passwords that are random and secure.
8. User-Friendly Interface: Simple and intuitive interface for easy use.
